# World of Bits

College assignment. Move around the real world, collecting and crafting tokens. Craft a high enough token to win.

## How To Play

Move around using buttons (defaults to my class's classroom) or your real world location. Swap between the two using the button.

Click a cell to pick up the stored token. Place it on an empty cell to set it down, place it on a full cell to swap them, or place it on a cell with a token of the same value to merge the two and create a new token of double the value.

Progress is automatically stored, and saves even after you close the game. Press the New Game button to reset progress.
